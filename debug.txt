Program 4-5

1. The integrated debugger was really cool to see and being able to use it. There were a lot of fancy things coming from gdb which made it nicer
to debug. Like keeping tabs on the stack and function calls, highlighting and showing what some data is set to on the left hand side.

2. I had a problem with data not being inserted in properly and I also ran into some trouble with me uncommenting things out and forgetting to
uncomment after tackling a problem. I used it to step through my program while I had a sheet of paper noting where things were and what the methods
were doing.

3. Definitely, something that was nice was that I didn't have to interact with it through the command line and it was kind of just already there
with a few clicks of some buttons. Like setting break points on the left where the line numbers are and being able to see while I still code around.
Then when time comes around to debug, I just had to select the option to run in in debug mode and bam, its there.

4. I want to learn how to see all the variables while debugging because I could partially see it on the left side, but I didn't really know how
to expand on it as much. I also just kept seeing the location of my objects, but I wanted to see what it's data members held and not the location.

5. I think my approach was valid even though for the most part the stuff I wrote just kind of worked becuase of Python and it being dynamically typed
language. I used the debugger to go line by line to find errors or logical errors that I made which the program didn't flag. I used it to help me make
my program more efficient by catching those things which contributes to me using the IDE debugger as it was intended for it to be.
